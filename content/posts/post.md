Copilot is writing this post for me. I'm just going to add some more text to it.

## What is Copilot?

Copilot is a new feature in VS Code that uses machine learning to help you write
code. It's currently in preview and is available for Python, JavaScript,
TypeScript, and Java. It's also available for Markdown, which is what I'm using
to write this post.

## How does it work?

Copilot uses machine learning to suggest code snippets based on what you're
writing. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good. It's also not a replacement for
your brain. It's just a tool to help you write code faster.

## How do I use it?

To use Copilot, you need to be using VS Code. You can download it from
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Once you have VS Code installed, you can
install Copilot by going to the Extensions tab and searching for "copilot".

## What's next?

I'm going to keep using Copilot and see how it goes. I'll write another post
about it in a few weeks.
